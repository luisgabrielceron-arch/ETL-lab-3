## Reflection on Analytics Project {#reflection}

### What This ETL Project Enabled

#### 1. Data-Driven Decision Making
**Before:** Decisions based on intuition and incomplete information
**After:** Decisions supported by KPI dashboards and historical analysis

**Example:** Instead of "let's expand to Mexico because growth feels good," we can say: "Mexico segment has 36% of customers but highest ARPU ($5,500/customer). Expanding there has 15-20% payback period."

#### 2. Performance Visibility
**Implementation:** Created star schema data warehouse with fact table grain at transaction level

**Benefit:** Can instantly answer:
- "Which products drive profit?" (networking 32%+ margin)
- "Which channels are growing?" (online accelerating)
- "Which geographies to prioritize?" (Mexico ARPU highest)

#### 3. Scalable Foundation
**Architecture:** Modular ETL with extract → transform → load pattern

**Future Extensions:**
- Add more data sources (customer surveys, competitor pricing)
- Implement real-time dashboards (vs batch monthly)
- Add predictive models (demand forecasting, churn prediction)
- Automated alerting (inventory low, profit down)
